# Input
# - An integer (k) representing the number of apple boxes you have

# Output
# - An integer representing the difference between number of red and yellow apples
#   - Rules
#     - The boxes range in size (m) from 1 to k
#     - Each box contains m * m apples
#     - Odd sized boxes contain only yellow apples
#     - Even sized boxes contain only red apples

# Approach
# - Initialize num red apples and num yellow apples to 0
# - Loop from 1 to k (inclusive)
#   - If current (m) is odd, increment num yellow apples by n * n
#   - Else, increment num red apples by n * n
# - Return num red - num yellow

# Problem
# You have k apple boxes full of apples. Each square box of size m contains 
# m Ã— m apples. You just noticed two interesting properties about the boxes:

# The smallest box is size 1, the next one is size 2,..., all the way up to size k.
# Boxes that have an odd size contain only yellow apples. Boxes that have an 
# even size contain only red apples. Your task is to calculate the difference 
# between the number of red apples and the number of yellow apples.

# Example

# For k = 5, the output should be
# appleBoxes(k) = -15.

# There are: 
    # 1 + 3 * 3 + 5 * 5 = 35 yellow apples
    # 2 * 2 + 4 * 4 = 20 red apples, 
# making the answer 20 - 35 = -15.
